The CSS element selector, 'app-heroes', matches the name of the HTML element that identifies this component within a parent component's template.

The ngOnInit() is a lifecycle hook. Angular calls ngOnInit() shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.

Always export the component class so you can import it elsewhere ... like in the AppModule.

AppComponent is a shell to the app.

Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data. Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own.
[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.
Some of the metadata is in the @Component decorators that you added to your component classes. Other critical metadata is in @NgModule decorators.

The most important @NgModule decorator annotates the top-level AppModule class.
